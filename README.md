# Weather-Temperature-Prediction

Predicts the weather temperature using attributes likeâ€“ humidity, precipitation, dew point and wind speed humidity etc. <br />
using time series data.<br />
The above mentioned parameters are used in the implementation of Long short-term memory(LSTM) and Back <br />
Propagation architecture. According to these variations the logic in Back Propagation will be developed and the change <br />
in other parameters with respect to one parameter will be predicted <br />
LSTM is used for the prediction - <br />
